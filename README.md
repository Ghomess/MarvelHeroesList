## Features

## Third-Party Libraries

Here's a list of third-party libraries used in this project and their purposes:

- **@react-navigation**: React Navigation is used for handling navigation within the app. It provides a flexible and customizable way to navigate between screens, a fast and effective way to add a stack navigatior, bottom tab navigator and a drawer navigatior. It's also one of the most used third-party libraries to handle navigation.
